## Webscrapping

- This was a mini-project on webscrapping using some packages such as BeautifulSoup and requests in python. 
The main objective of the project is to extract top-rated tv shows from 1955 to 2019 from imdb webpage[imdb](https://www.imdb.com/chart/toptv). 

#### Elaboration of steps

- During the project, there were some few steps that were taken: 

 - Scrap the raw html file using request package 
 - After I used the BeautifulSoup to parse the file as html text. 
 - Extract somme key features from the html file to form csv file. 

This brief explanation of the project. Comments and suggestions are warmly welcome. I hope it become useful to you. Thank you
